### Random Notes

- Similar to the way Joe Pass sees all chords as major, minor, or dominant, Barry sees all chords as either tonic or dominant function (where tonic may be major or minor)
- Barry teaches a workshop once a week in New York! <http://www.barryharris.com/jazz_workshop.html>

### How to play a 2-5-1

There are only 2 functions of chords: tonic and dominant. The 2 chord has dominant function.

For a major 2-5-1, just play 5 over 2.

For a minor 2-5-1, the 2 chord (a m7b5 chord) can be substituted for an equivalent dominant chord.
E.g. Bm7b5 can be substituted for G7 (or even better, G9).

Although I don't this this is a Barry thing, Bm7b5 can also be substituted for Dm6.

### Rules for adding semitones to descending lines

These rules ensure that as you descend the scale on eighth notes, "good" notes always land on the beat.

These can be practiced by playing chords (4 note arpeggios) up and descending lines down.
4 different chords can be created from a dominant 7th chord by ascending thirds starting on the 1, 3, 5, and 7, respectively.

Also try "pivoting". This means taking the first note in the arpeggio and displacing it one octave up.

Also add triplets while ascending the chords for extra bebop spice.

#### Dominant 7th Scale (Mixolydian)

Use this over a dominant chord (e.g. G7 in key of C).

- Start on 1, 3, 5, or 7
  - Add 1 semitone between 1 and 7
- Start on 2, 4, or 6
  - Don't add semitone
  - Add 2 semitones: between 2 and 1, 1 and 7
- Start on 3, 5, or 7
  - Add 3 semitones: between 3 and 2, 2 and 1, 1 and 7

#### Major Tonic (Ionian)

Use this over a major tonic chord (e.g. Cmaj7).
Can also be used over the 3 or 6 chord (since these have tonic function).

Interesting to note here is that the 6th (not the 7th) is grouped with 3 and 5. 
I think this is related to the minor 6th diminished scale.

- Start on 1
  - Add 1 semitone between 6 and 5
- Start on 2, 4
  - Don't add semitones
  - Add 2 semitones: between 2 and 1, 6 and 5
- Start on 3, 5, 6
  - Add 1 semitone between 6 and 5
  - Add 3 semitones: between 3 and 2, 2 and 1, 6 and 5
- Start on 7
  - Add 1 semitone between 6 and 5
  - Add 2 semitones: between 2 and 1, 6 and 5
  - Add 2 semitones: between 3 and 2, 2 and 1
  - Add 2 semitones: between 7 and 6, 6 and 5

#### Minor Tonic (Aeolian)

Use this over a minor tonic chord (e.g. Cm7 in key of Cm).
These rules are based on harmonic minor.

Note that the natural 7th is considered a chord tone.

- Start on 1
  - Jump up to 2 then continue descending (1 2 7 6 ...)
- Start on 2, 4, 6
  - Don't add semitones
  - Add semitone between 2 and 1, add jump up after 1
- Start on 3, 5, 7
  - Add jump up after tonic
  - Add jump up after 3, add semitone between 2 and 1, add jump up after 1
