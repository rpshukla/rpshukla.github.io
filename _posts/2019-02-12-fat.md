I probably should be doing other things than writing this blog post. I have three midterms this week including one tomorrow. Yet here I am.

Why do I do this to myself? Why would I give myself extra work while I'm already so busy?

Because I need FAT.

Fucking Around Time, or FAT, is a term I've coined for the little bits of time I claim each day as my own. I mean *really* my own. Not doing assignments. Not doing chores. Instead, doing things nobody is making me do, but I want to do out of my own accord.

Sometimes this is watching my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pegzch" target="_blank">favourite</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/standupmaths" target="_blank">YouTube</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/styropyro" target="_blank">channels</a>. Sometimes it's working on my music or my other side projects. Sometimes it's reading (although not nearly enough). It can be passive, like listening to music, or active, like writing this blog post, depending on how I'm feeling.

Why do I need FAT?

When I'm busy I tend to go through the day feeling like I'm not in control of my time. Most of the time I'm going from lecture to lecture and using any breaks I get to work on assignments. I feel like university is dictating where I go and what I do. However, during FAT I feel in control. I can do things I enjoy, improve myself, and build things I'm proud of.

The obvious problem with FAT is that, as my econ prof put it, time is a scarce resource. Some days I will literally spend every free minute trying to keep up with assignments. I might finish my work right before bedtime (or push bedtime back). These are the days when I really feel like I need FAT because I have not been in control the entire day. However, if I start to take some FAT, I will most likely get sucked in to whatever I'm doing and push my bedtime back even further. If I just go to sleep, I'll be more rested the next day, but I'll feel a lack of control.

What's the solution?

I don't know. I need more sleep.
